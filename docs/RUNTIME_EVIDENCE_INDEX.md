# Runtime Evidence Index

Generated from imported runtime evidence under `evidence/runtime/`.

- Access evidence files: 2
- Probe result files: 2
- Evidence rows: 15
- Objectdump symbols discovered: 0

- Probe candidates doc present: yes

Objectdump discovery means a symbol exists in static dump data. It does not mean runtime access is safe.

## Health Source Scope Notes

- `CrabPS` health rows are player-state-scoped because the probe path starts from `CrabPC -> PlayerState -> CrabPS`.
- `FindFirstOf.CrabHC` is unscoped and ambiguous as a player-health source. Session `20260505T002614Z` observed `BP_Destructible_ChaoticBarrel10.HC`, so unscoped `CrabHC` must not be used as the CrabInvSync v2 player health source.
- `CrabHC` read success proves only that the observed component can be read. It does not prove player ownership unless a later discovery phase establishes that relationship.
