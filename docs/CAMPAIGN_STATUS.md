- Latest session: 20260505T055346Z
- Latest commit: d5f22ad6f321d6734ce77d07df73129d94f962bc
- Latest summary: evidence/runtime/20260505T055346Z/diagnostic_summary.txt

## Completed Phases

- `smoke-startup` - Startup smoke
- `executeDelay` - executeDelay tick driver
- `observe-context` - Observe runtime context
- `equipment-property-read` - Equipment data asset property reads
- `health-playerstate-read` - PlayerState health scalar reads
- `health-playerstate-watch` - Solo PlayerState health watch
- `multiplayer-roster-read` - Multiplayer roster identity read
- `multiplayer-health-playerstate-watch` - Multiplayer PlayerState health watch

## Partial Phases

- None.

## Failed Phases

- None.

## Blocked Phases

- `crystals-read` - Crystals read placeholder: Probe set is not implemented yet.
- `slots-read` - Slots read placeholder: Probe set is not implemented yet.
- `inventory-array-shallow-read` - Inventory array shallow read placeholder: Probe set is not implemented yet.
- `inventory-array-count-read` - Inventory array count read placeholder: Probe set is not implemented yet.
- `inventory-element-da-read` - Inventory element data asset read placeholder: Probe set is not implemented yet and would require explicit deep-read review.
- `inventoryinfo-scalar-read` - InventoryInfo scalar read placeholder: Probe set is not implemented yet and InventoryInfo remains disabled until this explicit phase.
- `enhancements-read` - Enhancements read placeholder: Probe set is not implemented yet.

## Pending Phases

- None.

## Confirmed Safe Paths

- `CrabPS.WeaponDA` via `GetPropertyValue`
- `CrabPS.AbilityDA` via `GetPropertyValue`
- `CrabPS.MeleeDA` via `GetPropertyValue`
- `CrabPC -> PlayerState -> CrabPS -> HealthInfo` read-only PlayerState health path
- `CrabPC -> PlayerState` local identity reads with redacted/fingerprinted identity values
- confirmed visible multiplayer roster reads

## Identity And Roster Notes

- Local player identity visible: yes
- Max visible player count observed: 2
- Any candidate exposed more than one player: yes
- Roster source candidates attempted: Identity.CrabGS.SourceCandidate, Identity.FindAll.PlayerStateCandidates, Identity.GameState.SourceCandidate, Identity.PlayerArray.Shape, Identity.PlayerControllerCandidates, Identity.VisiblePlayers.SourceCandidate
- Visible roster source resolved: yes
- Raw IDs/names emitted: no, redacted/fingerprinted by default
- PlayerName and UniqueId can be fingerprinted from PlayerState identity reads without emitting raw values.
- `solo-or-host` means local-player-present in the current detector; it is not proof that the run was solo and cannot distinguish true solo from multiplayer host-like local context.
- Visible player roster source is confirmed; future auto-room grouping still requires matched host and joined-client runs.

## Confirmed Unsafe Paths

- HUD ReceiveDrawHUD tick hook remains blocked by default.
- `FindFirstOf.CrabHC` is not confirmed as a player-health source; imported evidence has seen an unscoped destructible/barrel candidate.
- Writes and RPCs are disabled and are outside this campaign version.

## Untested Paths

- Vanilla multiplayer local PlayerState health visibility is confirmed only after `multiplayer-health-playerstate-watch` evidence exists; pooled/shared health is a CrabInvSync design concept, not vanilla RuntimeProbe evidence.
- Multiplayer roster identity is only complete after visible roster evidence exists; local PlayerState identity alone is partial evidence.
- Roster candidate probes currently include GameState/GameStateBase source identity, CrabGS source identity, PlayerArray shape, capped FindAll PlayerState-like candidates, capped PlayerController/CrabPC candidates, and a capped visible players source candidate.
- Crystals, slots, inventory arrays, `InventoryInfo`, and enhancements are placeholders until explicit probe sets are implemented.
- Deep arrays and InventoryInfo gates remain off until their explicit reviewed phases.

## Safety Gate Summary

- Default config remains `tickDriver = none`, `probeSet = shallow-core`, and all research gates false.
- Campaign read phases never enable writes, RPCs, or HUD hooks.
- `allowHealthProbes` is enabled only for explicit health phases.
- `allowIdentityProbes` is enabled only for the explicit multiplayer roster phase; `allowRawIdentityEvidence` remains false by default.
- `allowDeepArrayProbes` and `allowInventoryInfoProbes` are not enabled by implemented phases.
