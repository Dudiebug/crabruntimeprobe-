# CrabRuntimeProbe Script Reference

This map is based on the current `scripts/*.ps1` and `tools/*.js` files. Prefer these helpers over manually copying old folders into the game install.

## Recommended Normal Workflow

Run `quick-smoke-prepare`, launch menu, quit, then `quick-smoke-collect`. Next prove `executeDelay` with `quick-tickdriver-prepare -TickDriver executeDelay` and `quick-tickdriver-collect`. Then use README or campaign order for observe, equipment, health, identity, resource, and inventory shape phases.

## Evidence Import Workflow

After a run is worth preserving, run:

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts\import-latest-runtime-evidence.ps1
```

This imports the latest game-side artifacts, regenerates evidence docs, and builds wiki staging. Do not run it casually if you do not want current generated evidence summaries updated.

## Troubleshooting No JSONL

Check `UE4SS.log` for CrabRuntimeProbe startup, config path, selected tick driver, result paths, and `tick source registered`. Confirm `Mods\mods.txt` contains `CrabRuntimeProbe : 1`. Check both `Mods\CrabRuntimeProbe\Scripts\results\` and the fallback `Mods\CrabRuntimeProbe\Scripts\`. For diagnostics, keep `mode = observe`, enable heartbeat/self-test only for the diagnostic pass, and leave `allowHudTickHook = false`.

## Default Path Versus Custom GameBin

Quick scripts use the default Steam path. For another install, call `run-local-diagnostic-cycle.ps1 -GameBin "<custom Win64 path>"` with the matching prepare/collect switch, or pass `-GameBin` to campaign scripts.
